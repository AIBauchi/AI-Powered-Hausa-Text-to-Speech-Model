# AI-Powered Hausa Text-to-Speech Model.

**Welcome!** This document serves as a guide for the AI-Powered Hausa Text-to-Speech Model project, developed in collaboration with the AI Bauchi Community. It outlines the project goals, current progress, upcoming milestones, and communication channels.

### **Project Goal:**

Develop a high-quality, AI-powered Text-to-Speech (TTS) model for the Hausa language, promoting its preservation and wider accessibility through natural-sounding voice technology.

**Project Phases:**

* **Data Collection and Preprocessing (Ongoing):**
    * Objective: Gather a diverse and representative dataset of Hausa speech, ensuring cultural and linguistic nuances are considered.
    * Progress: Currently collecting over 2000 speech samples from various speakers, dialects, and speaking styles. Data cleaning and pre-processing ongoing.
    * Checkpoint: Review data diversity and quality with AI Bauchi Community Leader by January 15th.
* **Model Architecture and Training (Planning):**
    * Objective: Choose and train a suitable TTS model architecture based on collected data and desired voice characteristics (e.g., female voice model named Amina).
    * Plans: Explore fine-tuning existing Coqui AI Hausa models and potentially training a custom model with additional data.
    * Team Meeting: Discuss model architecture options with AI Bauchi Community Leader on January 20th.
* **Testing and Evaluation (Future):**
    * Objective: Assess the performance and naturalness of the trained model on various metrics.
    * Plans: Develop testing criteria and evaluation methods in collaboration with the AI Bauchi Community.
    * Checkpoint: Present preliminary model performance results to AI Bauchi Community on February 5th.
* **Deployment and Scaling (Future):**
    * Objective: Make the TTS model accessible for real-world applications and explore potential scaling options.
    * Plans: Investigate deployment platforms and consider community feedback for accessibility and usage.
    * Team Meeting: Discuss deployment strategies and user feedback with AI Bauchi Community on February 20th.

**Team Roles:**

* Project Lead: Amina Shiga ([link to profile])
* Linguistic Expert: Amina Gadiya ([link to profile])
* AI Bauchi Community Leader: [Name and contact information] (to be confirmed)
* **Additional roles to be filled based on project needs**

**Communication and Collaboration:**

* Weekly Progress Meetings: Every Tuesday at 10:00 AM WAT (online platform to be determined)
* Team Meetings with AI Bauchi Community Leader: As outlined in project phases
* Project Documentation: Maintain updated README and project wiki
* Open Communication: Encourage active participation and feedback from all team members and the AI Bauchi Community

**Next Steps:**

* Continue data collection and pre-processing, ensuring data diversity and quality.
* Research and finalize model architecture options for discussion with the AI Bauchi Community Leader.
* Develop testing criteria and evaluation methods for the trained model.
* Set up communication channels and schedule regular meetings with the AI Bauchi Community Leader.

**We believe this project has the potential to significantly contribute to the preservation and accessibility of the Hausa language. We invite everyone to participate and share their valuable insights!**

**Thank you for your support!**
