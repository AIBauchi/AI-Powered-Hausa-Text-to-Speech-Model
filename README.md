# AI-Powered Hausa Text-to-Speech Model Project

Welcome to the repository for the AI-Powered Hausa Text-to-Speech Model project! This document serves as a guide for team members, providing an overview of the project, steps to follow, and roles within the team.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a State-of-the-Art (SOTA) AI model for Text-to-Speech (TTS) in the Hausa language. The project involves collecting and preprocessing Hausa text and audio data, training a TTS model, testing and evaluating its performance, and deploying the model for real-world applications.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

- **Objective:** Gather a diverse and representative dataset for Hausa language, preprocess data for model training.

### 2. Model Architecture and Training

- **Objective:** Choose a suitable TTS model architecture, train the model using the prepared dataset.

### 3. Testing and Evaluation

- **Objective:** Assess the performance of the trained model.

### 4. Iterative Development and Feedback

- **Objective:** Continuously improve the model based on feedback.

### 5. Documentation

- **Objective:** Maintain comprehensive documentation for the project.

### 6. Quality Assurance

- **Objective:** Implement and maintain quality assurance measures.

### 7. Deployment and Scaling

- **Objective:** Plan for model deployment and assess scalability.

### 8. Reporting and Checkpoints

- **Objective:** Ensure regular communication and progress tracking.

## Team Roles

- **Project Manager:** [Amina Shiga](https://github.com/Sheega-ameenah)
  - Oversees the entire project, ensures alignment with goals and objectives.


- **Linguist:** [Amina Gadiya]
  - Provides linguistic expertise, ensuring cultural and language nuances are considered in model development.

## Reporting and Checkpoints

- **Weekly Progress Meetings:** TBD
  - Discuss individual and team progress, address challenges.

- **Biweekly Technical Review Sessions:** TBD
  - Provide updates on model development and training, discuss technical issues.

- **Monthly Stakeholder Feedback Sessions:** TBD
  - Share progress with stakeholders, gather feedback.

- **Milestone Checkpoints:** At the completion of significant project milestones
  - Conduct a thorough review and assessment of progress.
